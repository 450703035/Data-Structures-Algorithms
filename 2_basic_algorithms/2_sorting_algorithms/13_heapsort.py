# Heapsort

'''
A heapsort is an in-place sorting algorithm that treats an array
like a binary tree and moves the largest values to the end of the
heap until the full array is sorted.

The main steps in a heapsort are:
    1. Convert the array into a maxheap 
       (a complete binary tree with decreasing values)
    2. Swap the top element with the last element in the array
       (putting it in it's correct final position)
    3. Repeat with arr[:len(arr)-1] 
       (all but the sorted elements)

Problem statement
In the cell below, see if you can code a heapsort function that
takes an array (or Python list) and performs a heapsort on it.
You will have to complete the heapify.
'''

def heapsort(arr):
    '''
    First convert the array into a maxheap by calling heapify on each
    node, starting from the end. Now that you have a maxheap, you can
    swap the first element (largest) to the end (final position) and
    make the array minus the last element into maxheap again.
    Continue to do this until the whole array is sorted.
    '''
    n = len(arr)

    # Build maxheap
    for i in range(n, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, n, i)

    # One by one extract elements
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        # Swap
        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]
        heapify(arr, i, 0)


def heapify(arr, n, i):
    '''
    Using i as the index of the current node, find the 2 child nodes
    (if the array were a binary tree) and find the largest value.
    If one of the children is liarger, swap the values and recurse
    into that subtree.
    '''

    # Consider current index as largest.
    largest_index = i
    left_node = 2 * i + 1
    right_node = 2 * i + 2

    # Compare with left child.
    if left_node < n and arr[i] < arr[left_node]:
        largest_index = left_node

    # Compare with right child.
    if right_node < n and arr[largest_index] < arr[right_node]:
        largest_index = right_node

    # If either of left or right child is the largest node.
    if largest_index != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest_index] = arr[largest_index], arr[i]

        heapify(arr, n, largest_index)
